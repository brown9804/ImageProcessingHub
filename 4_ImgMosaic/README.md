You will need to use Python 3, so it is recommended to update it or download it. This program creates a mosaic of an input image with images from a directory. If you want to download images of puppies, go to the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset

To run the program, you should have the following Python libraries: 
- opencv
- matplotlib
- numpy

It is done in the following way:

-If your computer works with Windows operating system, run the following in the command line or console: python get-pip.py to install pip pip3 install opencv-python pip3 install matplotlib pip3 install numpy-python
-If your computer works with Mac or Linux operating system, run the following in the command line or console: curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py sudo python get-pip.py sudo pip3 install opencv-python sudo pip3 install matplotlib sudo pip3 install numpy

To run the program, you should execute the following command:

```python3 main.py imagen.jpg directory```

Where imagen.jpg is the image to convert (if the image has another extension, put it, for example, if it is png put imagen.png) and directory is the image directory with which the mosaic will be created.
