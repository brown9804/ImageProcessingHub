---------------

This project provides a Python script to convert an input image into a vectorized image using KMeans clustering.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip

### Usage

1. Place your input image in the project directory and name it `input.png`.
2. Run the `main.py` script:

```python 
python main.py
```

3. The vectorized image will be saved as `vector_output.png` in the project directory. SVG and PDF versions of the image will also be created.

## Built With

- OpenCV - Used for image processing
- NumPy - Used for numerical computations
- Pillow - Used for handling images
- scikit-learn - Used for KMeans clustering
- Matplotlib - Used for creating the output image
