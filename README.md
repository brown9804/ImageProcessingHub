---------------

This repository hosts a collection of different algorithms for image analysis, edition, etc

## Content 

1. `python` [Filter Spectrum](./FilterSpectrum/README.md): This algorithm allows analyzing the different present characteristics of each image.
2. `python` [Image Vectorizer](./ImageVectorizeKMeansCluster/README.md): This algorithm provides a Python script to convert an input image into a vectorized image using KMeans clustering.
3. `python` [High Resolution Image Mosaic](./HighResolutionImgMosaic/README.md): This program creates a high resolution mosaic of an input image with images from a directory.
4. `python` [Image Mosaic](./HighResolutionImgMosaic/README.md): This program creates a mosaic of an input image with images from a directory.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip

## Usage

The usage depends on the specific algorithm you want to run. Generally, you would place your input image in the project directory and run the corresponding script.

## Built With

- OpenCV - Used for image processing
- NumPy - Used for numerical computations
- Pillow - Used for handling images
- scikit-learn - Used for KMeans clustering
- Matplotlib - Used for creating the output image
