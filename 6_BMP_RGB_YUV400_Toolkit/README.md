----------

This program is designed to perform various image processing operations in C. It includes functions for reading parameters from a text file, reading an RGB image from a BMP file, converting an RGB image to an intensity image, drawing a line segment and a circle on the intensity image, and saving the intensity image in a YUV400 file.
